# Problems I faced
I was not able to make a drop down menu. Therefore, such places wherever, I was not able to do so I have left that part or not modified it. I have left it in the following places: 
* In the navbar while hovering over the links the drop down menu is not being shown.

I haven't modified the elements to show drop down memnu in such scenarios where the drop down is being shown after the window width shrinks: 
* Navbar
* Footer part


In the `How It Works` section I was not able to figure out how to represent those boxes with respect to the laptop image. Therefore I have left that part too.
